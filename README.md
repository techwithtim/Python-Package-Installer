# Python-Package-Installer
A python package installer that will install all required packages from code into the python interpreter it was run in. Useful for releasing unpackaged code.

# Intructions
Simply place all of the python packages you would like installed inside of *requirements.txt*

When you'd like to install them you can run *install_requirements.py* or import the module:
```python
import install_requirements
```
